 const { chatId, isDetailOpen } = useChatStore();//You subscribe to the ChatStore to get the chatId and isDetailOpen state. Your component will now automatically re-render whenever any of these values (currentUser, isLoading, chatId, etc.) change.

    // You tell React to run the code inside this function once when the App component first loads.
    fetchUserInfo();//This checks Supabase: "Is a user already logged in from a previous visit?"


    // Listen for authentication state changes (login, logout).This is a key Supabase feature. You are setting up a real-time listener that watches for auth events.

      (event, session) => {
        // When the auth state changes, re-fetch the user info.you call fetchUserInfo() again
